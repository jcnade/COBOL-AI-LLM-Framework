Usage Guide for COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework

Welcome to the usage guide for the COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework. This guide will help you understand how to use the framework to create AI applications using COBOL.

Basic Usage

1. Initialize the Framework

Before using any AI features, you need to initialize the framework. This can be done by calling the initialization procedure in your COBOL program.

Example:
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-AI.
AUTHOR. Jean-Charles Nadé.

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
CONFIGURATION SECTION.
SOURCE-COMPUTER. IBM-370.
OBJECT-COMPUTER. IBM-370.

DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01  WS-MESSAGE         PIC X(50) VALUE 'Initializing AI with COBOL...'.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PARA.
    DISPLAY WS-MESSAGE.
    PERFORM INIT-LLM-FRAMEWORK.
    PERFORM PROCESS-INPUT-TEXT.
    DISPLAY 'Initialization Complete'.
    STOP RUN.

INIT-LLM-FRAMEWORK.
    DISPLAY 'Loading COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework...'.
    * Simulate framework initialization
    PERFORM DUMMY-WAIT.
    DISPLAY 'COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework Initialized Successfully'.

DUMMY-WAIT.
    PERFORM VARYING WS-COUNTER FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS-COUNTER > 5000
        CONTINUE
    END-PERFORM.

2. Process Input Text

To process input text through the LLM, use the provided processing procedures. This example demonstrates a simple text processing task.

Example:
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-AI.
AUTHOR. Jean-Charles Nadé.

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
CONFIGURATION SECTION.
SOURCE-COMPUTER. IBM-370.
OBJECT-COMPUTER. IBM-370.

DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01  WS-INPUT-TEXT      PIC X(100) VALUE 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'.
01  WS-PROCESSED-TEXT  PIC X(100).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
MAIN-PARA.
    DISPLAY 'Processing Input Text...'.
    PERFORM PROCESS-INPUT-TEXT.
    DISPLAY 'Input Text: ' WS-INPUT-TEXT.
    DISPLAY 'Processed Text: ' WS-PROCESSED-TEXT.
    STOP RUN.

PROCESS-INPUT-TEXT.
    DISPLAY 'Processing Input Text through LLM...'.
    * Simulate text processing
    MOVE FUNCTION REVERSE(WS-INPUT-TEXT) TO WS-PROCESSED-TEXT.

Advanced Usage

1. Integrating with Legacy Systems

The COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing COBOL-based legacy systems. Ensure that the initialization procedure is called before any processing tasks.

2. Custom AI Models

For advanced users, custom AI models can be integrated into the framework. Follow the documentation provided in the `docs` directory for detailed instructions on how to implement custom models.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the framework, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure the framework is properly initialized before processing any text.
- Verify the input data format matches the expected format.
- Check for any errors in your COBOL code syntax.

For further assistance, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository or consult the community.

Conclusion

You are now ready to use the COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework to build powerful AI applications with COBOL. Explore the examples and documentation to unlock the full potential of the framework.
