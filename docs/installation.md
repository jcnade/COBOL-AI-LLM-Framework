Installation Guide for COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework

Welcome to the installation guide for the COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the framework on your system.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- COBOL Compiler (OpenCOBOL or GnuCOBOL recommended)
- Git
- Basic understanding of COBOL programming

Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework.git
cd COBOL-AI-LLM-Framework

2. Compile the Framework

Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the `llm_framework.cbl` file:

cd src
cobc -x llm_framework.cbl -o llm_framework

This command compiles the `llm_framework.cbl` file and produces an executable named `llm_framework`.

3. Run the Framework

Run the compiled framework executable to ensure everything is set up correctly:

./llm_framework

You should see an output message indicating that the AI processing with COBOL has been initiated.

Example Program

To verify the installation, you can also run the example COBOL program provided in the `examples` directory:

1. Compile the Example Program

Navigate to the `examples` directory and compile the `hello_ai.cbl` file:

cd ../examples
cobc -x hello_ai.cbl -o hello_ai

2. Run the Example Program

Run the compiled example program:

./hello_ai

You should see output messages indicating the initialization and processing of AI with COBOL.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed and configured correctly.
- Verify that you have cloned the correct repository URL.
- Check for any syntax errors in the COBOL files.

For further assistance, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository or consult the community.
